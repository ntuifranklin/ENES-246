CRITICAL WARNING: [Board 49-67] The board_part definition was not found for digilentinc.com:nexys4_ddr:part0:1.1. This can happen sometimes when you use custom board part. You can resolve this issue by setting 'board.repoPaths' parameter, pointing to the location of custom board files. Valid board_part values can be retrieved with the 'get_board_parts' Tcl command.
